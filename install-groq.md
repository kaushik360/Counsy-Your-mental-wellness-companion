# Installing Groq SDK

Since the package manager isn't available in this environment, you'll need to install the Groq SDK manually:

## Option 1: Using npm
```bash
npm install groq-sdk
```

## Option 2: Using yarn
```bash
yarn add groq-sdk
```

## Option 3: Using pnpm
```bash
pnpm add groq-sdk
```

After installation, the TypeScript errors should resolve and you can use your free Groq API key!
